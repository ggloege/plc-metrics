        Each month the PLC team sends a 6-question survey to each active product council across Pearson. The results tell us about the level and rigor of activity around PLC across the business. The long term goal is to get the charts to go up and to the right. However, in the short term these are important indicators of where and how the PLC team can support these groups as they transition to a more responsive and agile way of managing products.
        <br><br>
        Each chart below includes a basic overview and a some notes about the latest month's data. <strong>All charts are up to date as of: <mark class="text-uppercase">December 1, 2016</mark></strong>

        <div class="section-overview">
          <p>This is the section for an overall look at the maturity of each product council across Pearson. Product council maturity is defined by 15 separate metrics. These 15 metrics are divided into 4 categories:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Beginner: Basic foundational activities that set a product council in motion.</li>
            <li>Novice: Early stage practices focused on establishing forward momentum.</li>
            <li>Pro: Fidelity oriented metrics that apply practices across the full breadth of a portfolio.</li>
            <li>Veteran: Specialized activities and edge cases that indicate full maturity.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Use the tabs to explore each of these categories in greater detail. The charts below roll up those categories to provide a high-level view of how product councils are adopting the Product Life Cycle tools and practices.</p>

              This chart stacks up each council’s progress towards maturity in the 4 types of metrics categories: beginner, novice, pro, and veteran. When they hit the targets for every metric in a single category, they are at 100% for that category. Thus a fully mature product council as defined here would be at 400%. To explore the metrics in each category, find the corresponding tab at the top of this section.

              Each bubble represents a product council. The bigger the bubble, the more revenue they generated in 2015 (2016 coming soon, I hope). Bubbles further to the right have stronger Beginner/Novice metrics. The higher the bubble, the stronger their Pro/Veteran metrics. The idea is that Beginner/Novice metrics represent momentum… regular activity practicing the PLC. And the Pro/Veteran metrics represent fidelity… stricter adherence to PLC principles. What we want are big bubbles that are up and to the right.

              Product council meetings are the basic pulse of PLC. We like to see them happening at least once each month per council. A few do them ad hoc because of a small portfolio. Others need to meet more often than that. It's just a rule of thumb.

          <h2>What are beginner metrics?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="section-overview">
          <p>A beginner council is focused on very simple, foundational metrics:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Members</b>: Have you identified all the members of your product council? This includes roles representing portfolio, finance, efficacy, technology, as well as a council chair and administrator.</li>
            <li><b>Charter</b>: Have you constructed a charter to guide the behavior of your product council? This is a self-created, living document (typically a Google doc) that includes members, meeting frequency, decision process, transparency guidelines, and other operating issues.</li>
            <li><b>AAW</b>: Have you held an accelerated adoption workshop, or a similar community alignment event? This is helps ensure clarity and consistency across the business unit and prevents the misunderstanding (or worse, false alignment) that occurs when training people in silos.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Once a council can answer yes to these three metrics we classify them as a Beginner level council.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="page-header">
          <h2>Members, Charter, AAW</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-4">
            <p>
              Each of these three metrics are binary. Either you’ve identified your members or you haven’t. Either you have a charter or you don’t. Either you held an AAW or you didn’t. So either the metric is at 100% or 0%. And with three metrics, a Beginner council would have their stacked bar at 300%.

          <h2>What are novice metrics?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="section-overview">
          <p>Novice level metrics are focused on momentum and grooving certain practices:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Meetings</b>: Are you meeting regularly? A meeting is an event with a certain pattern and rhythm to it. The more you meet, the better you get at meeting. We think it takes 5 product council meetings to smooth out the friction points and get into a groove.</li>
            <li><b>Decisions</b>: Are you making decisions? Coming to clear decisions about the right issues in a timely manner is the essential output of a product council. We think it takes 10 decisions before a council finds their groove on decision making.</li>
            <li><b>Templates</b>: Are you using the templates when submitting and reviewing investment requests? These templates help product teams and councils focus on the right questions at the right stage. They serve as scaffolding to Novice councils to understand the key questions at each stage. We think after reviewing 5 different, fully completed templates council members will have sufficient fluency with them.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>There is also the issue of <b>Granularity</b>, which is the process of mapping a business unit’s product portfolio to the Pearson product taxonomy, then choosing the level at which the council wants to govern investment decisions. At this stage we simply want to see that they have <i>initiated</i> that process, which can take a couple months depending on the size of the portfolio.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="page-header">
          <h2>Novice Metric Stack</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-4">
            <p>
              This chart shows where the councils are hitting our targets in each of the four metrics (5 meetings, 10 decisions, 5 template submissions, started granularity). Hitting the target equals 100%, so with 4 metrics a Novice council will be at 400%.

            <p>
              This isn’t a maturity metric, but it’s useful to track. Two decisions per meeting, on average, is a fine target. Less than one means some meetings have no decisions at all. Yikes. An ideal decision takes under 20 minutes: 10 minute presentation, 10 minute discussion. We find the more you shop the pitch around before the council meeting, the faster the decision tends to happen.

        <div class="section-overview">
          <p>At the Pro level we move away from momentum and towards fidelity. We want to see the practices that have been established start to work their way across the entire portfolio. We also want to see financial discipline and data management start to take center stage. These metrics include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Thresholds</b>: Each PLC stage has financial thresholds that determine how much money a council can invest in a single project. We want to see at least 10 investment decisions that have been within the defined threshold for that PLC stage.</li>
            <li><b>% Portfolio</b>: If a business unit has 100 products and they have brought 20 of those products before the council, either for a stage-gate decision or a quarterly review, then we say 20% of their portfolio is governed by the PLC. Our target at this stage is 50%.</li>
            <li><b>% Planview</b>: Councils eventually need to enter every investment decision they make into the Planview system, which provides full portfolio analysis and reporting tools. This can be a lengthy process, so at this stage we are looking for just a non-zero % of progress.</li>
            <li><b>% Quarterlies</b>: Every product on the right side of the PLC needs to be reviewed each quarter to determine its performance in the market and whether it should move to a different stage. At this stage we want to see 25% of their right side products go through a quarterly review.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Given the scale of some portfolios, reaching Pro level can take well over a year. Don’t lose heart. Use these metrics as a guide to help prioritize product council agendas and work towards maturity.</p>

        <div class="section-overview">
          <p>The Veteran level takes a long time to reach. It should be measured in years. Here we are looking for comprehensive application of the PLC plus experience with edge case decisions like pruning and retiring products. These metrics include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Pruned</b>: We want to run lots of experiments, place lots of small bets, and stop the ones that have demonstrated they won’t work before we invest too much. We want to avoid “spectacular failure.” If we don’t prune anything then we aren’t coming up with enough ideas or we aren’t being critical enough. A Veteran council has pruned at least 10 projects on the left side of the PLC.</li>
            <li><b>Retired</b>: Drag always beats thrust, so it’s important that we clear out the old products that aren’t delivering value or are no longer in our strategic targets. This frees us up to focus on new innovation and growth opportunities. A Veteran council has moved at least 5 products from Sustain to Retire.</li>
            <li><b>Reallocated</b>: The point of retiring products is to free up resources (capital, people, and mindshare) to reallocate to other opportunities. This metric tracks the actual dollar value of those reallocations. A Veteran council has reallocated at least £500,000 back into other budgets via retired products.</li>
            <li><b>Budget</b>: Our Pro metric % Portfolio measured the number of products that have gone before a product council. This metric measures the % of the entire annual product investment budget that has been allocated via the product council’s decisions. A Veteran council has processed 100% of their annual product investment budget through product council decisions.</li>
