        Each month the PLC team sends a 6-question survey to each active product council across Pearson. The results tell us about the level and rigor of activity around PLC across the business. The long term goal is to get the charts to go up and to the right. However, in the short term these are important indicators of where and how the PLC team can support these groups as they transition to a more responsive and agile way of managing products.

          <h2>What are beginner metrics?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="section-overview">
          <p>A beginner council is focused on very simple, foundational metrics:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Members</b>: Have you identified all the members of your product council? This includes roles representing portfolio, finance, efficacy, technology, as well as a council chair and administrator.</li>
            <li><b>Charter</b>: Have you constructed a charter to guide the behavior of your product council? This is a self-created, living document (typically a Google doc) that includes members, meeting frequency, decision process, transparency guidelines, and other operating issues.</li>
            <li><b>AAW</b>: Have you held an accelerated adoption workshop, or a similar community alignment event? This is helps ensure clarity and consistency across the business unit and prevents the misunderstanding (or worse, false alignment) that occurs when training people in silos.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Once a council can answer yes to these three metrics we classify them as a Beginner level council.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="page-header">
          <h2>Members, Charter, AAW</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-4">
            <p>
              Each of these three metrics are binary. Either you’ve identified your members or you haven’t. Either you have a charter or you don’t. Either you held an AAW or you didn’t. So either the metric is at 100% or 0%. And with three metrics, a Beginner council would have their stacked bar at 300%.

          <h2>What are novice metrics?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="section-overview">
          <p>Novice level metrics are focused on momentum and grooving certain practices:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Meetings</b>: Are you meeting regularly? A meeting is an event with a certain pattern and rhythm to it. The more you meet, the better you get at meeting. We think it takes 5 product council meetings to smooth out the friction points and get into a groove.</li>
            <li><b>Decisions</b>: Are you making decisions? Coming to clear decisions about the right issues in a timely manner is the essential output of a product council. We think it takes 10 decisions before a council finds their groove on decision making.</li>
            <li><b>Templates</b>: Are you using the templates when submitting and reviewing investment requests? These templates help product teams and councils focus on the right questions at the right stage. They serve as scaffolding to Novice councils to understand the key questions at each stage. We think after reviewing 5 different, fully completed templates council members will have sufficient fluency with them.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>There is also the issue of <b>Granularity</b>, which is the process of mapping a business unit’s product portfolio to the Pearson product taxonomy, then choosing the level at which the council wants to govern investment decisions. At this stage we simply want to see that they have <i>initiated</i> that process, which can take a couple months depending on the size of the portfolio.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="page-header">
          <h2>Novice Metric Stack</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-4">
            <p>
              This chart shows where the councils are hitting our targets in each of the four metrics (5 meetings, 10 decisions, 5 template submissions, started granularity). Hitting the target equals 100%, so with 4 metrics a Novice council will be at 400%.

            <p>
              This isn’t a maturity metric, but it’s useful to track. Two decisions per meeting, on average, is a fine target. Less than one means some meetings have no decisions at all. Yikes. An ideal decision takes under 20 minutes: 10 minute presentation, 10 minute discussion. We find the more you shop the pitch around before the council meeting, the faster the decision tends to happen.

        <div class="section-overview">
          <p>At the Pro level we move away from momentum and towards fidelity. We want to see the practices that have been established start to work their way across the entire portfolio. We also want to see financial discipline and data management start to take center stage. These metrics include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Thresholds: Each PLC stage has financial thresholds that determine how much money a council can invest in a single project. We want to see at least 10 investment decisions that have been within the defined threshold for that PLC stage.</li>
            <li>% Portfolio: If a business unit has 100 products and they have brought 20 of those products before the council, either for a stage-gate decision or a quarterly review, then we say 20% of their portfolio is governed by the PLC. Our target at this stage is 50%.</li>
            <li>% Planview: Councils eventually need to enter every investment decision they make into the Planview system, which provides full portfolio analysis and reporting tools. This can be a lengthy process, so at this stage we are looking for just a non-zero % of progress.</li>
            <li>% Quarterlies: Every product on the right side of the PLC needs to be reviewed each quarter to determine its performance in the market and whether it should move to a different stage. At this stage we want to see 25% of their right side products go through a quarterly review.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Given the scale of some portfolios, reaching Pro level can take well over a year. Don’t lose heart. Use these metrics as a guide to help prioritize product council agendas and work towards maturity.</p>

              Just because a product goes to council doesn't mean that a decision is being made whether or not to invest.

I’ll get more information on their process soon and post it here.

On average there are 6 decisions happening per meeting, but only 2.5 decisions per meeting if you take Brazil out of it. The ideal product council is can make an incremental investment decision in under 20 minutes, so 3 to 4 in an hour.

              Each council manages a portfolio of products. That portfolio needs to be mapped to Pearson's global product taxonomy. That mapping process is known as "product granularity." So this question is asking whether or not you've started that process. It's a scale of 1-4. The higher the number, the more fully mapped is their portfolio.

              <strong class="bg-info">October notes</strong>: The granularity data seems to be strong. Every council is at least aware of the granularity mapping process and most of them have started the process of mapping their portfolio. China has apparently mapped their entire portfolio. Remember, this is the critical step in getting up and running with Planview, so if you have mapped at least a few of the products in your portfolio, let’s start talking about getting you set up in Planview soon

            Below is a network map of the PLC community. Each node (dot) is a person. Either a product council member or a PLC coach. Connections represent their membership on different councils. Try the following and see what happens: hover over a node, click on a node, press the Settings button on the right and play with the Cluster menu. Have fun!
