        Each month the PLC team sends a 6-question survey to each active product council across Pearson. The results tell us about the level and rigor of activity around PLC across the business. The long term goal is to get the charts to go up and to the right. However, in the short term these are important indicators of where and how the PLC team can support these groups as they transition to a more responsive and agile way of managing products.
        <br><br>
        Each chart below includes a basic overview and a some notes about the latest month's data. <strong>All charts are up to date as of: <mark class="text-uppercase">December 1, 2016</mark></strong>

              Product council meetings are the basic pulse of PLC. We like to see them happening at least once each month per council. A few do them ad hoc because of a small portfolio. Others need to meet more often than that. It's just a rule of thumb.

          <h2>What are beginner metrics?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="section-overview">
          <p>A beginner council is focused on very simple, foundational metrics:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Members</b>: Have you identified all the members of your product council? This includes roles representing portfolio, finance, efficacy, technology, as well as a council chair and administrator.</li>
            <li><b>Charter</b>: Have you constructed a charter to guide the behavior of your product council? This is a self-created, living document (typically a Google doc) that includes members, meeting frequency, decision process, transparency guidelines, and other operating issues.</li>
            <li><b>AAW</b>: Have you held an accelerated adoption workshop, or a similar community alignment event? This is helps ensure clarity and consistency across the business unit and prevents the misunderstanding (or worse, false alignment) that occurs when training people in silos.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Once a council can answer yes to these three metrics we classify them as a Beginner level council.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-header">
          <h2>Members, Charter, AAW</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-4">
            <p>
              Each of these three metrics are binary. Either you’ve identified your members or you haven’t. Either you have a charter or you don’t. Either you held an AAW or you didn’t. So either the metric is at 100% or 0%. And with three metrics, a Beginner council would have their stacked bar at 300%.

              Just because a product goes to council doesn't mean that a decision is being made whether or not to invest. So we track the number of actual decisions made in order to determine the financial aspect of PLC activity. The goal is to make smaller, faster bets that are based on real engagement with customers.

              <strong class="bg-info">October notes</strong>: Brazil, again, is making as many decisions as the rest of the product councils combined. I’ll get more information on their process soon and post it here. Both the Middle East and UK Qualifications made a dozen decisions this month, but the former did it in a single meeting while the latter did it over three. On average there are 6 decisions happening per meeting, but only 2.5 decisions per meeting if you take Brazil out of it. The ideal product council is can make an incremental investment decision in under 20 minutes, so 3 to 4 in an hour. Use that as a target to shoot for, and a guide for gauging how many meetings you need to have in order to process your backlog of investment decisions.

              Each council manages a portfolio of products. That portfolio needs to be mapped to Pearson's global product taxonomy. That mapping process is known as "product granularity." So this question is asking whether or not you've started that process. It's a scale of 1-4. The higher the number, the more fully mapped is their portfolio.

              <strong class="bg-info">October notes</strong>: The granularity data seems to be strong. Every council is at least aware of the granularity mapping process and most of them have started the process of mapping their portfolio. China has apparently mapped their entire portfolio. Remember, this is the critical step in getting up and running with Planview, so if you have mapped at least a few of the products in your portfolio, let’s start talking about getting you set up in Planview soon

            Below is a network map of the PLC community. Each node (dot) is a person. Either a product council member or a PLC coach. Connections represent their membership on different councils. Try the following and see what happens: hover over a node, click on a node, press the Settings button on the right and play with the Cluster menu. Have fun!
